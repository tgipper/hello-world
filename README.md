# hello-world
My first Github repository

I am a musician with a degree in jazz performance, and I also do a lot of work in auio recording, photography, and videography. I have been raised around computer hardware development, and have always had an intrest in software and web development. I'm excited to learn more about writing software and see if it's something I want to pursue.
